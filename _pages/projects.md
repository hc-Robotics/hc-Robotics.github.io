  <p style="margin-bottom: -5px;"><strong>Description</strong>:
    Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air aerial systems, offer prolonged duration and enhanced safety in human-robot interactions due to their buoyant lift. However, robust flight against environmental airflow disturbances remains a significant challenge, limiting the broader application of these robots.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: -2px;">
    Drawing inspiration from the flight mechanics of birds and their ability to perch against natural wind, this project introduces RGBlimp-Q, a robotic gliding blimp equipped with a birdinspired continuum arm. This arm allows for flexible attitude adjustments through moving mass control to enhance disturbance resilience, while also enabling object capture by using claws to counteract environmental disturbances, similar to a bird. This project presents the design, modeling, and prototyping of RGBlimp-Q, thus extending the advantages of robotic blimps to more complex environments. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first interdisciplinary design integrating continuum mechanisms onto robotic blimps. Experimental results from both indoor and outdoor settings validate the improved flight robustness against environmental disturbances offered by this novel design.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="margin-bottom: -5px;"><strong>Description</strong>:
    A robotic blimp, as one type of lighterthan-air aerial vehicle, has attracted increasing attention in the science and engineering field for its long flight duration and safe aerial locomotion. While a variety of robotic blimps have been developed over the past decade, most of them utilize the buoyant lift and neglect the aerodynamic lift in their design, thus leading to a mediocre aerodynamic performance, particularly in terms of aerodynamic efficiency and aerodynamic stability.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: -2px;">
    This project proposes a new design of robotic blimp that combines desirable features of both a robotic blimp and a fixed-wing glider, named the <i>Robotic Gliding Blimp</i>, or <i>RGBlimp</i>. This robot, equipped with an envelope filled with helium and a pair of wings, uses an internal moving mass and a pair of propellers for its locomotion control. This project presents the design, dynamic modeling, prototyping, and system identification of the RGBlimp.  Experimental results are presented to validate the design and the dynamic model of the RGBlimp. Analysis of the RGBlimp aerodynamics is conducted which confirms the performance improvement of the proposed RGBlimp in aerodynamic efficiency and flight stability.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="margin-bottom: -5px;"><strong>Description</strong>:
     The Robot Combat Competition is a defensive and offensive contest between robots of red and blue teams. Each team's robots must navigate obstacles, engage opponents, and attack the opponent's life tower. The team with the highest score wins. The 12m x 12m arena has bases at opposite corners and obstacles like broken bridges and turntables. We designed four different wheeled robots, including one remotely operated through visual teleoperation. We emerged as champion after intense competition. 
  </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: -5px;"><strong>Outcome</strong>:
    <strong>Champion</strong> in Robots Competition of Universities at Beijing, 2015 (Team Leader, Robots Battle)
